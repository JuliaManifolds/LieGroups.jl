# LieGroups.jl (WIP)

This is a package (work-in-progress) rework the Lie group featues of [`Manifolds.jl`](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/) in a unified way.

This especially also includes a few different choices in default behabiour that
is different from the `Manifolds.jl` one. For purely manifold-based operations, any Lie group still is “build upon” a Riemannian manifold.

See [#1](https://github.com/JuliaManifolds/LieGroups.jl/issues/1) for an overview of fatures that are plannned.
Feel free to add to this list with opening further issues.
