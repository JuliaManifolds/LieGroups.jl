# About LieGroups.jl

`LieGroups.jl` is a “spin-off” from [`Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/stable/), where `GroupManifolds` where implemented around 2021.
Around the same time, [Yueh-Hua Tu](https://github.com/yuehhua) started a package `LieGroups.jl`, which was continued than here with a full rewrite to use the manifolds from `Manifolds.jl`.
