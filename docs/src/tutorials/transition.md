# Transition from `GroupManifolds` in `Manifolds.jl`

One predecessor of `LieGroups.jl` are the [`GroupManifold`](@extref `Manifolds.GroupManifold`)s in `Manifolds.jl`.
While this package provides the same features, one reason for a new package is,
that a “restart” offers the opportunity to put the main focus for the functions in this package
really on Lie groups.

This tutorial provides an overview of the necessary changes to your code if you based it on the predecessor.

## Table of function names and its successors

The following table lists all functions related to `GroupManifolds` and their new names
or replacements here in `LieGroups.jl`. In this code `G` always refers to the `GroupManifold`
in the first column and the [`LieGroup`](@ref) in the second.
Lie group elements (points) are always `g,h`,
Lie algebra elements (vectors) always `X, Y`.

New functions and types in this package are only mentioned, if they are worth a comment and if something changed.

The list is alphabetical, but first lists types, then functions

| `Manifolds.jl` | `LieGroups.jl` | Comment |
|:---------- |:---------- |:-------------- |
| `AdditionOperation` | [`AdditionGroupOperation`](@ref) | |
| `LeftForwardAction` | [`LeftGroupOperationAction`](@ref)
| `LeftBackwardAction` | [`InverseRightGroupOperationAction`](@ref) | note that this is now also aa [`AbstractLeftGroupActionType`](@ref) |
| | [`LieAlgebra`](@ref)`(G)` | new alias to emphasize its manifold- and vector structure as well as for a few dispatch methods. |
| `GroupManifold(M, op)` | [`LieGroup`](@ref)`(M, op)` | |
| `PowerGroup(M)` | [`PowerLieGroup`](@ref)`(G,n)` | The main change is, that the constructor now requires a Lie group to build the power Lie group; This also allows for `G^n`. The other two former constructors for nested and nested-replacing are no longer necessary. `PowerLieGroup` behaves exactly the same as [`PowerManifold`](@extref `ManifoldsBase.PowerManifold`). |
| `ProductGroup(M)` | [`ProductLieGroup`](@ref)`(G, H)` | The main change is, that the constructor now requires two Lie groups to build their product. This also allows for the short hand `G×H` to generate this product. |
| `SemidirectProductGroup(G, H, a)` | [`LeftSemidirectProductLieGroup`](@ref)`(G, H, a)` | While this staid the same, there is now also the [`default_left_action`](@ref)`(G,H)`. When this agrees with `a` you can use the short hand `G⋉H` to generate this semidirect product. Analogously there now also exists the [`RightSemidirectProductLieGroup`](@ref)`(G,H)` with[`default_left_action`](@ref)`(G,H)` that allows for the short cut `G⋊H` |
| `RightBackwardAction` | [`RightGroupOperationAction`](@ref) | |
| `RightForwardAction` | [`InverseLeftGroupOperationAction`](@ref) | note that this is an [`AbstractRightGroupActionType`](@ref) |
| `adjoint_action` | [`adjoint`](@ref) | now implemented with a default, when you provide [`diff_conjugate!`](@ref).
| `apply_diff` | [`diff_apply`](@ref) | modifiers (diff) come first, consistent with [`ManifoldsDiff.jl`](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/ManifoldDiff.jl/stable/) |
| `apply_diff_group` | [`diff_group_apply`](@ref) | modifiers (diff/group) come first, consistent with [`ManifoldsDiff.jl`](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/ManifoldDiff.jl/stable/) |
| | [`conjugate`](@ref), [`diff_conjugate`](@ref) | a new function to model ``c_g: \mathcal G → \mathcal G`` given by ``c_g(h) = g∘h∘g^{-1}`` |
| `differential_exp_argument_lie_approx` | - | Scheduled for update and renaming. Though available in `ManifoldDiff.jl` for `GroupManifolds`, that will move to `differential_exp_argument_approx` instead, since `exp_lie` changed to now just `exp`. |
| `exp(G, g, X)` | `exp(`[`base_manifold`](@ref base_manifold(G::LieGroup))`(G), g, X)` | the previous defaults whenever not agreeing with the Riemannian one can now be accessed on the internal manifold |
| `exp_inv(G, g, X)` | [`exp`](@ref exp(G::LieGroup, g, X))`(G, g, X)`  | the exponential map invariant to the group operation is the default on Lie groups here |
| `exp_lie(G, X)` | [`exp`](@ref exp(G::LieGroup, X))`(G, X)` | the (matrix/Lie group) exponential |
| `inverse_translate(G, g, h, c)` | [`inv_left_compose`](@ref)`(G, g, h)`, [`inv_right_compose`](@ref)`(G, g, h)` | compute ``g^{-1}∘h`` and ``g∘h^{-1}``, resp. |
| `inverse_translate_diff(G, g, h, X, LeftForwardAction())` | - | discontinued, use `diff_left_compose(G, inv(G,g), h)` |
| `inverse_translate_diff(G, g, h, X, RightBackwardAction())` | - | discontinued, use `diff_left_compose(G, h, inv(G,g))` |
| `log(G, g, h)` | `log(`[`base_manifold`](@ref base_manifold(G::LieGroup))`(G), g, h)` | you can now access the previous defaults on the internal manifold whenever they do not agree with the invariant one |
| `log_inv(G, g, h)` | [`log`](@ref log(G::LieGroup, g, h))`(G, g, h)` | the logarithmic map invariant to the group operation is the default on Lie groups here |
| `log_lie(G, g)` | [`log`](@ref log(G::LieGroup, g))`(G, g)` | the (matrix/Lie group) logarithm |
| `switch_direction(A)` | [`inv`](@ref inv(::GroupAction))`(A)` | switches from an action to its inverse action (formerly the direction forward/backward, sometimes even left/right, do not confuse with the side left/right). |
| `switch_side(A)` | [`switch`](@ref switch(::GroupAction))`(A)` | switches from a left action to its corresponding right action. |
| `translate(G, g, h)` | [`compose`](@ref)`(G, g, h)` | unified to `compose` |
| `translate_diff(G, g, X, c)` | [`diff_left_compose`](@ref)`(G, g, h, X)`, [`diff_right_compose`](@ref)`(G, g, h, X)` | for compose ``g∘h`` the functions now specify whether the derivative is taken w.r.t. to the left (`g`) or right (`h`) argument |
| `VeeOrthogonalBasis` | [`DefaultLieAlgebraOrthogonalBasis`](@ref) | |

## Further notable changes

1. In general the default for tangent vectors is now to represent them in the [`LieAlgebra`](@ref), which obtains its own name now, though defined as a constant of a certain tangent space.
2. In accordance with point 1., the [`GeneralLinearGroup`](@ref) (formerly `GeneralLinear`) switched to using its Lie algebra to represent tangent vectors.
3. Formerly, both a power manifold of Lie groups as a manifold as well as a Lie group of a power manifold as a Lie group were possible. This is unified to just defining `G^n` as the Lie group on the power manifold with the element-wise group operation.
4. Formerly, product manifolds were stored as a [`ProductManifold`](@extref) of Lie groups and an indicator for the group operation, that the direct product should be used. This is switched to internally only store a [`ProductManifold`](@extref) as well as a (new) [`ProductGroupOperation`](@ref) that specifies one group operation for every factor.
5. The last two points achieve one unified modelling aspect of Lie groups: they are now always a manifold `M` together with a group operation `op`, but a Lie group does not store another Lie group (or product of them) internally with one common type they share, a [`LieGroup`](@ref).
