    angles_4d_skew_sym_matrix(A)

The Lie algebra of [`Orthogonal`](@ref)`(4)` in ``ℝ^{4×4}``, ``𝔰𝔬(4)``, consists of ``4×4``
skew-symmetric matrices. The unique imaginary components of their eigenvalues are the
angles of the two plane rotations. This function computes these more efficiently than
`eigvals`.

By convention, the returned values are sorted in decreasing order.
